   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p12"/>I passed a night of unmingled wretch<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_190" n="171"/>edness. In the
            morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal
            question; but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballots
            had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p13"/>I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced sensations of
            horror; and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words
            cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to
            whom I addressed myself added, that Justine had already confessed her guilt. “That
            evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it;
            and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence,
            be it ever so decisive.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p13"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p14"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_191" n="171"/>When I returned home, Elizabeth eagerly demanded the
            result.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p15"/>“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather
            that ten innocent should suffer, than that one guilty should escape. But she has
            confessed.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p16"/>This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justine’s
            innocence. “Alas!” said she, “how shall I ever again believe in human benevolence?
            Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of
            innocence only to betray; her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or ill humour,
            and yet she has committed a murder.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p17"/>Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a wish to see my cousin. My
            father wished her not to go; but said, that he left it to her own <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_192" n="173"/>judgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth,
            “I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me: I cannot go
            alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p17"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p18"/>We entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the
            further end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees. She rose on
            seeing us enter; and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of
            Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p18"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p19"/>“Oh, Justine!” said she, why did you rob me of my last consolation. I relied on your
            innocence; and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am
            now.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p19"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p20"/>“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_193" n="174"/>join with my enemies to crush me?” Her voice was
            suffocated with sobs.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p20"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p21"/>“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth, “why do you kneel, if you are innocent? I am not
            one of your enemies; I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I
            heard that you had yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be
            assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but
            your own confession.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p21"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p22"/>“I did confess; but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but
            now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins. The God of heaven
            forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and
            menaced, until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_194" n="175"/>said I was. He threatened excommunication and hell fire
            in my last moments, if I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all
            looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do? In an evil
            hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p22"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p23"/>She paused, weeping, and then continued—“I thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you
            should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you
            loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have
            perpetrated. Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in heaven,
            where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and
            death.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p23"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p24"/>
   <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_195" n="176"/>“Oh, Justine! forgive me for having for one moment
            distrusted you. Why did you confess? But do not mourn, my dear girl; I will every where
            proclaim your innocence, and force belief. Yet you must die; you, my playfellow, my
            companion, <longToken>my more than sister.</longToken> I never can survive so horrible a misfortune.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p24"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p25"/>“Dear, sweet Elizabeth, do not weep. You ought to raise me with thoughts of a better
            life, and elevate me from the petty cares of this world of injustice and strife. Do not
            you, excellent friend, drive me to despair.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p25"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26"/>“I will try to comfort you; but this, I fear, is an evil too deep and poignant to admit
            of consolation, for there is no hope. Yet heaven bless thee, my dearest Justine, with
            resignation, and a confidence elevated beyond this world. Oh! how I hate its shows and
              mock<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_196" n="177"/>eries! when one creature is murdered, another
            is immediately deprived of life in a slow torturing manner; then the executioners, their
            hands yet reeking with the blood of innocence, believe that they have done a great deed.
            They call this <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26_hi1"/>retribution<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26_hi1"/>. Hateful name! When that word is
            pronounced, I know greater and more horrid punishments are going to be inflicted than
            the gloomiest tyrant has ever invented to satiate his utmost revenge. Yet this is not
            consolation for you, my Justine, unless indeed that you may glory in escaping from so
            miserable a den. Alas! I would I were in peace with my aunt and my lovely William,
            escaped from a world which is hateful to me, and the visages of men which I abhor.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p27"/>Justine smiled languidly. “This, dear lady, is despair, and not resign<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_197" n="178"/>ation. I must not learn the lesson that you would teach
            me. Talk of something else, something that will bring peace, and not increase of
            misery.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p27"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p28"/>During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison-room, where I could
            conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared talk of that? The poor
            victim, who on the morrow was to pass the dreary boundary between life and death, felt
            not as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth, and ground them together,
            uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who it
            was, she approached me, and said, “Dear Sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope,
            do not believe that I am guilty.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p28"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p29"/>I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more convinced <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_198" n="179"/>of your innocence than I was; for even when he heard
            that you had confessed, he did not credit it.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p29"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p30"/>“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those
            who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as
            I am! It removes more than half my misfortune; and I feel as if I could die in peace,
            now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p30"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p31"/>Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed gained the
            resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my
            bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also wept, and was unhappy;
            but her’s also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the
            fair moon, for a while hides, but cannot tar<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_199" n="180"/>nish its
            brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell
            within me, which nothing could extinguish. We staid several hours with Justine; and it
            was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away. “I wish,” cried she,
            “that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p31"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p32"/>Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter
            tears. She embraced Elizabeth, and said, in a voice of half-suppressed emotion,
            “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven in its
            bounty bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever
            suffer. Live, and be happy, and make others so.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p32"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p33"/>As we returned, Elizabeth said, “You know not, my dear Victor, how much I <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_200" n="181"/>am relieved, now that I trust in the innocence of this
            unfortunate girl. I never could again have known peace, if I had been deceived in my
            reliance on her. For the moment that I did believe her guilty, I felt an anguish that I
            could not have long sustained. Now my heart is lightened. The innocent suffers; but she
            whom I thought amiable and good has not betrayed the trust I reposed in her, and I am
            consoled.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p33"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p34"/>Amiable cousin! such were your thoughts, mild and gentle as your own dear eyes and
            voice. But I—I was a wretch, and none ever conceived of the misery that I then
            endured.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p34"/>
