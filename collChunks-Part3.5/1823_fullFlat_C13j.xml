            “Your arrival, my dear cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find
            some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she be convicted
            of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own. Our misfortune is
            doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl,
            whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I
            never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be
            happy again, even after the sad death of my little William.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p48"/>

            I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a
            manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.” She wept.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p50"/>

            rely on the justice of our judges, and the activity with which I shall prevent the
            slightest shadow of partiality.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p51"/>
