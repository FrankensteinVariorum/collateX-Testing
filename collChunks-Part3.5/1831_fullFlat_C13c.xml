    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p21"/>Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on
    my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses
    arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p21"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p22"/>My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console
    and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town,
    I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded
    into my mind. I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for
    nearly six years. How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and
    desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by
    degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might
    not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I dared not advance, dreading a thousand
    nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p22"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p23"/>I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the
    lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, “the palaces
    of nature,” were not changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I
    continued my journey towards Geneva.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p23"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p24"/>The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native
    town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of
    Mont Blanc. I wept like a child. “Dear <pb xml:id="F1831_v_076" n="60"/>mountains! my
    own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky
    and lake are blue and placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my
    unhappiness?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p24"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p25"/>I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary
    circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with
    pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but a native can tell the delight I took
    in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p25"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26"/>Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed around;
    and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture
    appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to
    become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in
    one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not
    conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p27"/>It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town
    were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the
    distance of half a league from the city. The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to
    rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered. As I could
    not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at
    Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightnings playing on the summit of Mont
    Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly; and, on
    landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress. It advanced; the
    heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its
    violence quickly increased.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p27"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p28"/>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every
    minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed from
    Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes,
    illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant
    every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered <pb xml:id="F1831_v_077" n="61"/>itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in
    Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm
    hung exactly north of the town, over that part of the lake which lies between the
    promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with
    faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain
    to the east of the lake.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p28"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p29"/>While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty
    step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed
    aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these
    words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near
    me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning
    illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature,
    and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly
    informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did
    he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No
    sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my
    teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure passed
    me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have destroyed that
    fair child. <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p29_hi1"/>He<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p29_hi1"/> was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere
    presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the
    devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging
    among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds
    Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p29"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p30"/>I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene
    was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind the events which I had
    until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress towards the creation; the
    appearance of the work of my own hands alive at my bedside; its departure. Two years had
    now nearly elapsed since the night on which <pb xml:id="F1831_v_078" n="62"/>he first
    received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a
    depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my
    brother?<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p30"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p31"/>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I
    spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the
    weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being
    whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of
    horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire,
    my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to
    me.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p31"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p32"/>Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were open, and I
    hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to discover what I knew of the
    murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when I reflected on the
    story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had
    met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also
    the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my
    creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly
    improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I
    should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of
    the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my
    relatives to commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a
    creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections
    determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p32"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p33"/>It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I told the servants
    not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of
    rising.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p33"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p34"/>Six years had elapsed, passed as a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in
    the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt.
    Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained to me. <pb xml:id="F1831_v_079" n="63"/>I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece. It was an
    historical subject, painted at my father’s desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in
    an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and
    her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the
    sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed
    when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive,
    and hastened to welcome me. He expressed a sorrowful delight to see me: “Welcome, my
    dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would
    have found us all joyous and delighted.</xml>
