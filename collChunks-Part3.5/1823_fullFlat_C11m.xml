    not remember Justine Moritz? Probably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore,
    in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom
    Justine was the third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father; but,
    through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_137" n="117"/>her, and, after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt
    observed this; and, when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to
    allow her to live at her house. The republican institutions of our country have produced
    simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that
    surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its
    inhabitants; and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners
    are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a
    servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties
    of a servant; a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of
    ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter5_div4_div5_p6"/></xml>
