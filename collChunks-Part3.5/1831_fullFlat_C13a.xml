    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p1"/>O<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p1_hi1"/>N<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p1_hi1"/> my return, I found the following letter from my
    father:—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p1"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p2"/>“My dear Victor,<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p2"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p3"/>“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to
    us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on
    which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.
    What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to
    behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our
    misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how
    shall I inflict pain on my long absent son? I wish to prepare you for the woful news,
    but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page, to seek the words
    which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p3"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p4"/>“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles de<pb xml:id="F1831_v_073" n="57"/>lighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is
    murdered!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p4"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p5"/>“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the
    transaction.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p5"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p6"/>“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in
    Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than
    usual. It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that
    William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested
    on a seat until they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen
    his brother: he said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to
    hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for him a long
    time, but that he did not return.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p6"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p7"/>“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell,
    when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house. He was not there.
    We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy
    had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also
    suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the
    night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and
    motionless: the print of the murderer’s finger was on his neck.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p7"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p8"/>“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the
    secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to
    prevent her; but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the
    neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my darling
    child!’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p8"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p9"/>“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived, it was
    only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let
    him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is
    gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We <pb xml:id="F1831_v_074" n="58"/>have no trace of him at present, although our exertions
    to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p9"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p10"/>“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually, and
    accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart. We are
    all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be
    our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live to
    witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p10"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p11"/>“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with
    feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering, the wounds of
    our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection for
    those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p11"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p12"/>“Your affectionate and afflicted father,<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p12"/>

    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p14"/>“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p14"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p15"/>Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe
    the despair that succeeded to the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my
    friends. I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p15"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p16"/>“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness,
    “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend, what has happened?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p16"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p17"/>I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the
    extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account
    of my misfortune.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p17"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p18"/>“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he; “your disaster is irreparable.
    What do you intend to do?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p18"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p19"/>“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p19"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p20"/>During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he could only
    express his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor William!” said he, “dear lovely child, <pb xml:id="F1831_v_075" n="59"/>he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had seen
    him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss! To die
    so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How much more a murderer, that could destroy
    such radiant innocence! Poor little fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends
    mourn and weep, but he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for
    ever. A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a subject
    for pity;
