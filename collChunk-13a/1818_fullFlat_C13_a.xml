   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p1"/>O<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p1_hi1"/>N<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p1_hi1"/> my return, I found the following letter from my
            father:—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p1"/>
   <ab sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_ab1"/>
   <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_ab1_hi1"/>”To<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_ab1_hi1"/> V. F<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_ab1_hi2"/>RANKENSTEIN<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_ab1_hi2"/>.<ab eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_ab1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p2"/>“<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p2_hi1"/>MY DEAR VICTOR<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p2_hi1"/>,<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p3"/>“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to
            us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on
            which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.
            What would be your surprise, my son, when <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_147" n="135"/>you
            expected a happy and gay welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?
            And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous
            to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on an absent child? I wish to
            prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims
            over the page, to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p4"/>“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was
            so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p5"/>“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the
            transaction.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p6"/>“Last Thursday (May 7th) I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in
            Plainpalais. The evening was <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_148" n="136"/>warm and serene, and
            we prolonged our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of
            returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were
            not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. Presently
            Ernest came, and inquired if we had seen his brother: he said, that they had been
            playing together, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought
            for him, and afterwards waited for him a long time, but that he did not return.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p7"/>“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell,
            when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house. He was not there.
            We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_149" n="137"/>boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the
            damps and dews of night: Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the
            morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active
            in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless: the print of the murderer’s
            finger was on his neck.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p8"/>“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the
            secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to
            prevent her; but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the
            neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my
            darling infant!’<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p9"/>“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived, it was
            only to weep and sigh. <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_150" n="138"/>She told me, that that same
            evening William had teazed her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she
            possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which
            urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace of him at present, although our
            exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved
            William.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p10"/>“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually, and
            accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart. We are
            all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be
            our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live to
            witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p10"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p11"/>“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_151" n="139"/>of vengeance
            against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead
            of festering the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with
            kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p11"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p12"/>“Your affectionate and afflicted father,<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p12"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p13"/>A<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p13_hi1"/>LPHONSE<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p13_hi1"/> F<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p13_hi2"/>RANKENSTEIN<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p13_hi2"/>.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p13"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p14"/>“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p14"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p15"/>Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe
            the despair that succeeded to the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my
            friends. I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p15"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p16"/>“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness,
            “are you always to be <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_152" n="140"/>unhappy? My dear friend,
            what has happened?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p16"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p17"/>I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the
            extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account
            of my misfortune.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p17"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p18"/>“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he; “your disaster is irreparable.
            What do you intend to do?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p18"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p19"/>“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p19"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p20"/>During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to raise my spirits. He did not do this by common
            topics of consolation, <longToken>but by exhibiting the truest sympathy.</longToken> “Poor William!” said he,
            “that dear child; he now sleeps with his angel mother. His friends mourn and weep, but
            he is at rest: he does not <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_153" n="141"/>now feel the murderer’s
            grasp; a sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a fit
            subject for pity; the survivors are the greatest sufferers, and for them time is the
            only consolation. Those maxims of the Stoics, that death was no evil, and that the mind
            of man ought to be superior to despair on the eternal absence of a beloved object, ought
            not to be urged. Even Cato wept over the dead body of his brother.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p20"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p21"/>Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on
            my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses
            arrived, I hurried into a cabriole, and bade farewell to my friend.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p21"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p22"/>My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console
            and sympathize with <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_154" n="142"/>my loved and sorrowing
            friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly
            sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through scenes
            familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years. How altered every
            thing might be during that time? One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a
            thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which,
            although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame
            me; I dared not advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,
            although I was unable to define them.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p22"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p23"/>I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the
            lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm, and the snowy <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_155" n="143"/>mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not
            changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey
            towards Geneva.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p23"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p24"/>The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native
            town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of
            <longToken>Mont Blanc;</longToken> I wept like a child: “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you
            welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid. Is
            this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p24"/>
