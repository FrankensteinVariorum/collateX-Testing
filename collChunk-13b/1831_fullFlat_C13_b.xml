   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p25"/>I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary
            circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with
            pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but a native can tell the delight I took
            in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p25"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26"/>Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed around;
            and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture
            appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to
            become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in
            one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not
            conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p27"/>It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town
            were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the
            distance of half a league from the city. The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to
            rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered. As I could
            not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at
            Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightnings playing on the summit of Mont
            Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly; and, on
            landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress. It advanced; the
            heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its
            violence quickly increased.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p27"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p28"/>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every
            minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed from
            Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes,
            illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant
            every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered <pb xml:id="F1831_v_077" n="61"/>itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in
            Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm
            hung exactly north of the town, over that part of the lake which lies between the
            promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with
            faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain
            to the east of the lake.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p28"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p29"/>While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty
            step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed
            aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these
            words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near
            me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning
            illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature,
            and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly
            informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did
            he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No
            sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my
            teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure passed
            me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have destroyed that
            fair child. <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p29_hi1"/>He<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p29_hi1"/> was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere
            presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the
            devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging
            among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds
            Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p29"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p30"/>I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene
            was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind the events which I had
            until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress towards the creation; the
            appearance of the work of my own hands alive at my bedside; its departure. Two years had
            now nearly elapsed since the night on which <pb xml:id="F1831_v_078" n="62"/>he first
            received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a
            depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my
            brother?<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p30"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p31"/>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I
            spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the
            weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being
            whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of
            horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire,
            my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to
            me.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p31"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p32"/>Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were open, and I
            hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to discover what I knew of the
            murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when I reflected on the
            story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had
            met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also
            the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my
            creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly
            improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I
            should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of
            the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my
            relatives to commence it. <longToken>And then</longToken> of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a
            creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections
            determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p32"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p33"/>It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I told the servants
            not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of
            rising.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p33"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p34"/>Six years had elapsed, passed as a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in
            the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt.
            Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained to me. <pb xml:id="F1831_v_079" n="63"/>I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece. It was an
            historical subject, painted at my father’s desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in
            an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and
            her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the
            sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed
            when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive,
            and hastened to welcome me. He expressed a sorrowful delight to see me: “Welcome, my
            dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would
            have found us all joyous and delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which
            nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems
            sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease
            her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor William! he was our darling and our
            pride!”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p34"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p35"/>Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my
            frame. Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality
            came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I
            enquired more minutely concerning my father, and her I named my cousin.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p35"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p36"/>“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused herself of having
            caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched. But since the murderer
            has been discovered—”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p36"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p37"/>“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to pursue him?
            It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a
            mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was free last night!”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p37"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p38"/>“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of wonder, “but to us the
            discovery we have made completes our misery. No one would believe it at first; and even
            now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would
            credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all <pb xml:id="F1831_v_080" n="64"/>the family, could suddenly become capable of so frightful, so appalling a
            crime?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p38"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p39"/>“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully; every one
            knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p39"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p40"/>“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced
            conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the
            evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried
            to-day, and you will then hear all.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p40"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p41"/>He related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered,
            Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for several days. During this
            interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the
            night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had
            been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant instantly showed it to one
            of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate;
            and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the
            poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of
            manner.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p41"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p42"/>This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, “You
            are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p42"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p43"/>At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his
            countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged
            our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster,
            had not Ernest exclaimed, “Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the
            murderer of poor William.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p43"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p44"/>“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father; “for indeed I had rather have been for
            ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ingratitude in one I valued so
            highly.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p44"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p45"/>“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p45"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p46"/>“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. <pb xml:id="F1831_v_081" n="65"/>She is to be tried to-day, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be
            acquitted.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p46"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p47"/>This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed
            every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I had no fear, therefore, that any
            circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her. <longToken>My tale
            was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness
            by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe,
            unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption
            and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world?</longToken><p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p47"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p48"/>We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last beheld her; <longToken>it had
            endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years. There was the
            same candour, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an expression more full of
            sensibility and intellect.</longToken> She welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival,
            my dear cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some means to
            justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she be convicted of crime? I
            rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own.<comment text="ebb: Typesetter error:               the period is missing at the end of the previous sentence which also comes at the end               of a line ."/> Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that
            lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by
            even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more. But she will not, I
            am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my
            little William.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p48"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p49"/>“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but
            let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p49"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p50"/>“How kind <longToken>and generous you are! every</longToken> one else believes in her guilt, and that made me
            wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so
            deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.” She wept.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p50"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p51"/>“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she is, as you believe, innocent,
