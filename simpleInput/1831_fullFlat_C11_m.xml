   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p5"/>“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you
   left us. The blue lake, and snow-clad mountains, they never change;—and I think our
   placid home, and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws. My
   trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions
   by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one change has
   taken place in our little household. <anchor type="subcollate" xml:id="C11-m"/>Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz
            entered our family? Probably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore, in a few
            words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was
            the third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father; but, through a strange
            perversity, her mother could not endure her, and, after the death of M. Moritz, treated
            her very ill. My aunt observed this; and, when Justine was twelve years of age,
            prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions
            of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the
            great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several
            classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised,
            their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same
            thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned
            the duties of a servant; a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include
            the idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter6_div4_div6_p5"/>
