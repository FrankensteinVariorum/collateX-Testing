   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p1"/>W<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p1_hi1"/>E<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p1_hi1"/> passed a few sad hours, until eleven o’clock, when the
            trial was to commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as
            witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery of
            justice, I suffered living torture. It was to be decided, whether the result of my
            curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow-beings: one a
            smiling babe, full of innocence and joy; the other far more dreadfully murdered, with
            every aggravation of in<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_173" n="161"/>famy that could make the
            murder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl of merit, and possessed qualities
            which promised to render her life happy: now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious
            grave; and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of
            the crime ascribed to Justine; but I was absent when it was committed, and such a
            declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman, and would not have
            exculpated her who suffered through me.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p1"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p2"/>The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning; and her countenance,
            always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful.
            Yet she appeared confident in innocence, and did not tremble, although gazed on and
            execrated by thousands; for all the <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_174" n="162"/>kindness which
            her beauty might otherwise have excited, was obliterated in the minds of the spectators
            by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil,
            yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been
            adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.
            When she entered the court, she threw her eyes round it, and quickly discovered where we
            were seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us; but she quickly recovered
            herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p2"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p3"/>The trial began; and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several
            witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her, which might have
            staggered any one <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_175" n="163"/>who had not such proof of her
            innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been
            committed, and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the
            spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her
            what she did there; but she looked very strangely, and only returned a confused and
            unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight o’clock; and when one
            inquired where she had passed the night, she replied, that she had been looking for the
            child, and demanded earnestly, if any thing had been heard concerning him. When shewn
            the body, she fell into violent hysterics, and kept her bed for several days. The
            picture was then produced, which the servant had found in her pocket; and when
            Elizabeth, in <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_176" n="164"/>a faltering voice, proved that it
            was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his
            neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p3"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p4"/>Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had
            altered. Surprise, horror, and misery, were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled
            with her tears; but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers, and spoke
            in an audible although variable voice:—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p4"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p5"/>“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend that my
            protestations should acquit me: I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of
            the facts which have been adduced against me; and I hope the character I have always
            borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation, where <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_177" n="165"/>any circumstance appears doubtful or
            suspicious.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p5"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p6"/>She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of
            the night on which the murder had been committed, at the house of an aunt at Chêne, a
            village situated at about a league from Geneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock,
            she met a man, who asked her if she had seen any thing of the child who was lost. She
            was alarmed by this account, and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates
            of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn
            belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well
            known. Unable to rest or sleep, she quitted her asylum early, that she might again
            endeavour to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_178" n="166"/>where his body lay, it was without her knowledge. That she had been
            bewildered when questioned by the market-woman, was not surprising, since she had passed
            a sleepless night, and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. Concerning the
            picture she could give no account.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p6"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p7"/>“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and fatally this one circumstance
            weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my
            utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it
            might have been placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have
            no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly.
            Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity afforded him <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_179" n="167"/>for so doing; or if I had, why should he have stolen
            the jewel, to part with it again so soon?<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p7"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p8"/>“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope. I beg
            permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character; and if their
            testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would
            pledge my salvation on my innocence.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p8"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p9"/>Several witnesses were called, who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of
            her; but fear, and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty, rendered them
            timorous, and unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her
            excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when,
            although violently agi<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_180" n="168"/>tated, she desired
            permission to address the court.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p9"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p10"/>“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his
            sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long
            before his birth. It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this
            occasion; but when I see a fellow-creature about to perish through the cowardice of her
            pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her
            character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived in the same house with
            her, at one time for five, and at another for nearly two years. During all that period
            she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame
            Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness with the greatest affection and care; and <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_181" n="169"/>afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious
            illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her. After which she
            again lived in my uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly
            attached to the child who is now dead, and acted towards him like a most affectionate
            mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say, that, notwithstanding all the
            evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had no
            temptation for such an action: as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she
            had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her; so much do I esteem
            and value her.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p10"/>
   <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p11"/>Excellent Elizabeth! A murmur of approbation was heard; but it was excited by her
            generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_182" n="170"/>the public indignation was turned with renewed
            violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth
            spoke, but she did not answer. My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole
            trial. I believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon, who had (I did not for a
            minute doubt) murdered my brother, also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent
            to death and ignominy. I could not sustain the horror of my situation; and when I
            perceived that the popular voice, and the countenances of the judges, had already
            condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the
            accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse
            tore my bosom, and would not forego their hold.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p11"/>
